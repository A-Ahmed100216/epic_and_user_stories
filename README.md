# User stories and use cases 

User Stories are a practice which enables agile users to move away from simply writing about requirements and end features, to having a discussion about them. This is not to say no writing is involved, but rather, the focus is more upon discussion and conversation. Hence, sticky notes or index cards are typically utilised and can be attached to walls or boards as a means of visually presentation. They typically follow the following format:

As a <role>, I want <task>, so that <goal>

A benefit of user stories is the ability to write varying levels of details. However, larger user stories are typically defined as epic stories 

## Examples:
A company has been given a set of requirements for a product. These are based upon features and functionalities the users wish to see. Thus, a user story would look like:

*As a user, I would like to see a preview of the file I will open, so that I can be sure this is the correct file*
