How do epic and user stories fit in Agile and Scrum 


# User stories and use cases 
## Definition
User Stories are a practice which enables agile users to move away from simply writing about requirements and end features, to having a discussion about them. This is not to say no writing is involved, but rather, the focus is more upon discussion and conversation. Hence, sticky notes or index cards are typically utilised and can be attached to walls or boards as a means of visually presentation. They typically follow the following format:
**As a [role], I want [task], so that [goal].**

A benefit of user stories is the ability to write varying levels of details. However, larger user stories are typically defined as epic stories. 

## Examples:
A company has been given a set of requirements for a product. These are based upon features and functionalities the users wish to see. Thus, a user story would look like:

**As a user, I would like to see a preview of the file I will open, so that I can be sure this is the correct file**

# Epic Stories and Use Cases 

## Definition
Epic stories are large user stories which are too large to be completed in one iteration. Thus, these can be broken down into smaller user stories. Epic stories follow the same template as a user story.

## Example
A company has been given a large project with several complex features. These features could be split up into smaller tasks. The team may wish to produce an epic story first before discussing which user stories it can be broken down into. Thus, an epic story may look like:
**As a user, I can view the interface most appropriate for my device because I do not want to manually change the view if I am watching a video on a desktop or a phone.** 

# Relation to SCRUM and Agile
User and Epic Stories fit in with Agile as they are a part of the Agile approach. Epic Stories are large tasks which are then broken into user stories. A user story is the smallest unit of work and fit well into the Scrum framework which is typically used to accomplish Agile methodology. The practice of condensing a user story into an index card or sticky note (or online alternative) allows the user story to easily transition between product backlog and sprint backlog where they can be added as an activity to be completed within a given sprint.
